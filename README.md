## Overview

This project has been one of my favorites. It involves working with large estructured data and it helped me to better understand how API fetching works, async calls, filtering methods.

### What I learned

During this project build, I learned how to properly manage a large amount of data that comes from APIs and how to effectively utilize that data to integrate it in the UI. Additionally, I learned how to correctly expect the data types for each property that comes from the API. It was a challenge, but using my knowledge and a bit of research, I was able to complete it on my own.

### Useful resources
